# First Light. Find Your Way For The Day.

First Light is a passion project by Shawn Kelley designed to help Christians start their day.

Some technical highlights from First Light include:

- URL encoding with React Router V6, enabling reproduction of randomly-selected content from the URL. (see an example with an amazing picture of Juptier here: https://firstlight-skd.netlify.app/space/q?manifest=https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/PIA22428/collection.json)
- Integration of diverse APIs, including Crossway's ESV API, several NASA APIs, and the Google Books API.
- UX emphasis on minimal friction and effort from the user.

Features include:

- Full Bible access via ESV's API.
- Randomly-selected verse presentation on site load.
- Curated space content from NASA.
- Minimalist task capture.
- Multi-Library querying powered Google Books and Gutendex APIs.
- A simple UI.
